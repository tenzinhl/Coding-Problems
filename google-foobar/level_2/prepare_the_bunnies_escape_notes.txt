What is the issue?

I'm failing a hidden verification test case online. Unclear where the issue is emerging

Guesses as to what the issue is:

# Guess 1: My pruning is over-eager/errored and is pruning out potential results

# Guess 2: My solution is timing out

# Guess 3: My solution isn't finding the optimal solution in one case

# Guess 4: Solution is incorrectly counting steps in certain situations

# Guess 5: Finding a false solution that shouldn't be possible
  - Skipping squares?
  - Improperly checking if square is blocked by wall?
  - Improperly remarking walls?

@ Approaches for solving:
- Testing
  Just write some test cases. Start small. Test for the above 4 guesses and some extra random cases

- Code review
  Keep thinking about the reasons and check the code for errors. Low priority imo

Argh... can't figure it out tonight. Will have to try some other time.
