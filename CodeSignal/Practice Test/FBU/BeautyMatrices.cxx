/* Problem statement: The beauty of a square 2D vector is the minimal positive
 * integer that doesn't appear in the vector. 
 * 
 * You are given a square 2D vector of numbers. The vector is divided into smaller
 * 2D vectors of size "size" by "size" (size will always evenly divide the side-length
 * of the larger vector). Each sub-vector is assigned a beauty score through
 * the method explained above.
 * 
 * Sort the vectors by ascending beauty, and then return a 2D vector of the original's
 * size, filling it from lowest to highest, left to right, then top to bottom.
